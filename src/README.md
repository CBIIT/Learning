### Description of the algorithm
A dataset is split into training (T), validation (V), and test (E). The model is trained on subsets of the training set (T). In order to support early stopping, the training is terminated if the generalization performance on the validation set V has not improved over a predefned number of training iterations. Upon training completion, the model predicts the response for each cell-drug pair in the test set E. Note that models use the same validation and test sets (V and E) irrespective of the training set size. The aggregated performance scores are than plotted as a function of the training set size.


### Expected Outcomes
* Raw learning curve data (LCraw) - csv file that contains the prediction scores for each subset of training samples
* Learning curves generated from LCraw - LCraw are then used to generate images of the learning curve plots 


### Setup
To set up the Python environment needed to generate learning curves:
1. Install [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) package manager.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Create the environment as shown below.

```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml -n lrn_crv
   conda activate lrn_crv
```

Download data that is required to build a tidy (tabular) dataset. The tidy dataset is then used to train the models and generate learning curves.
1. Create an account on the Model and Data Clearinghouse [MoDaC](modac.cancer.gov). 
2. Follow the instructions in the Training section below.
3. When prompted by the training and test scripts, enter your MoDaC credentials.


### Generte the tidy ML dataset
Once the data is downloaded from MoDaC, run the script to create the ML dataset.
```bash
./scripts/gen_dfs_new.bash
```

#### Description of the Data
The drug response dataframe contains tabular data for training models and generating learning curves: `data/ml.dfs/July2020/data.ctrp.dd.ge/data.ctrp.dd.ge.parquet`
* The dataframe contains 254566 of unique cell-drug pairs (samples, rows) and 2815 columns (including RNA-Seq and drug descritors, and metadata).
* There are 812 unique cell lines and 495 unique drugs (note that not all cell-drug combinations were screened)
* RNA-Seq: 976 features (genes)
* Mordred drug descriptors: 1825 features (descriptors)
 

### Train models and generate learning curves
To train LighGBM regressor and generate learning curves:
```bash
./scripts/lc_lgb.bash ctrp
```

To train neural network regressor and generate learning curves:
```bash
./scripts/lc_lgb.bash ctrp
```
